|1801|Recruitment|
|1802|We need developers!!!|
|1803|1. Media/resource finding agents: Because the textures and audios using now|
|1804|   are taken through internet, I wish we can find proper media/resources.|
|1805|2. 2D artists: GUI are made by me. And in order to fit the style of Star Trek,|
|1806|   2D artist is needed.|
